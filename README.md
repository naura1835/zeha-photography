## Overview

### Links

Website [Zeha Photography](https://)

### Approach

After coming up with a design, i set up the backend of the project using strapi which is an open source headless CMS, i have used contentful before but this is my first time using strapi. Once the backend was set, it was back to the frontend. After working on the overall look of the page, i started working on the connection to the strapi api and logic to make everything work as it should

### What I Learned

Using file system route API to create dynamic pages that displays project details. Using strapi as a headless CMS to serve as a backend and deploying it to heroku.
